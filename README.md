  # Introduction
  Our app, RenoVision, aims to eliminate the need for typical calculations
  of home renovation projects.  Normally, you would need to pull out the ol'
  ruler, tape measure, and a means to store/add up the measurements.  Sure, you
  can find calculators online for 'paint estimation', 'flooring estimation', 
  or 'roofing estimation', but there is no system that combines all of these
  features into one area.  Furthermore, the current setup of the most common 
  renovation calculators are hard to navigate through, don't offer sufficient
  input boxes to get precise measurements, and don't account for various other
  problems/techniques that go into home renovation products.  Secondly, there is
  not really a software system that is specific to construction workers that would
  allow them to register for jobs local to their area.  
  In order to remedy these problems, we created RenoVision as a hub for various
  types of estimations (painting, flooring, and roofing) as well as a platform
  to connect potential clients with contractors. We have implemented the linkage
  to an AR measurement app on the user's phone which is used to take the 
  measurements of their surface(s) in order to calculate a result.  The process
  of estimation is pretty intuitive, and allows for great flexibility with the
  used metrics.  Secondly, we added a contractor registration form for contractors
  who want to show up in the 'view contractors' list to be pointed out to potential
  clients also on the app.  
  We have lots of features we wanted to add, but due to time constraints and
  technical skill, we have produced an app with the features listed prior.
  RenoVision sees a gap in the marketplace where there is no main tool for these
  kind of projects or networking with contractors and aims to be the predominant
  name for all home renovation needs one day.
